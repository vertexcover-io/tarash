name: orchestrate
description: >
  Multi-agent pipeline orchestrator. Takes a prompt or spec file and runs:
  brainstorm (interactive), Q&A (interactive), planner (sub-agent), coder (sub-agent with
  TDD + stagnation detection), quality gate, sync-docs, capture learnings, and commit/PR. Artifacts stored in
  docs/spec/<name>/. Use when the user says orchestrate, run the pipeline, full workflow,
  or wants end-to-end development from spec to PR.

# Orchestrate: Multi-Agent Development Pipeline

Runs a full development pipeline in 9 stages. Brainstorm and Q&A run interactively in the main conversation. All other stages are dispatched as sub-agents via the `Agent` tool.

**Announce at start:** "Using the orchestrate skill to run the full development pipeline."

---

## Input Detection

The argument is either an **inline prompt** or a **spec file path**.

**Detection logic:**
1. Check if the argument is a path to an existing file (use `Bash` to test with `[ -f "<arg>" ]`)
2. If file exists → read its contents as the task spec
3. If not a file → treat the argument as an inline task prompt

Store the resolved input as `TASK_CONTEXT` — this is passed to every stage.

## Execution Rules

### Sub-Agent Prompt Preamble

Every sub-agent prompt MUST start with this preamble (referred to as `[PREAMBLE]` in stage templates below):

```
You are working in the worktree at <WORKTREE_PATH>.
Your working directory is <WORKTREE_PATH>.

## Constitution
<CONSTITUTION>
```

### Stages 0-2 Run in Main Conversation

Stages 0 (Setup), 1 (Brainstorm + Spec), and 2 (Q&A) run directly in the main conversation — NOT as sub-agents.

- **Stage 0** runs in main so we can `cd` into the worktree and set the working directory for everything that follows.
- **Stage 1** runs in main because brainstorm requires interactive dialogue with the user.
- **Stage 2** runs in main because Q&A requires interactive dialogue with the user.

Invoke their respective skills directly using the `Skill` tool. All other stages (3-8) run as sub-agents via the `Agent` tool.

### Pipeline Flow

```dot
digraph pipeline {
  rankdir=LR
  node [shape=box]

  stage_0 [label="0: Setup"]
  stage_1 [label="1: Brainstorm"]
  stage_2 [label="2: Q&A"]
  stage_3 [label="3: Planner"]
  stage_4 [label="4: Coder"]
  stage_5 [label="5: Quality Gate"]
  stage_6 [label="6: Sync Docs"]
  stage_7 [label="7: Learnings"]
  stage_8 [label="8: Commit & PR"]

  stage_0 -> stage_1 -> stage_2 -> stage_3 -> stage_4
  stage_4 -> stage_5 -> stage_6 -> stage_7 -> stage_8
}
```

Stage 4 (Coder) is the only stage with internal parallelism — see "Parallel When Possible" below.

### Parallel When Possible

After Stage 3, read the **phase graph** from plan.md (DOT digraph) and dispatch in waves:

**Phase waves:** Compute **ready nodes** = phases with no incomplete predecessors. Dispatch all ready phases in parallel. After each wave completes, recompute → dispatch next wave.

**Per phase, choose ONE strategy:**
- **Has step graph** in `phase-N.md` → dispatch steps in waves (same ready-node logic), skip phase-level agent
- **No step graph** → single agent for the whole phase

**To parallelize:** Send multiple `Agent` tool calls in a single message.

---

## Sub-Agent Dispatch

### Stage 0: Setup (Main Conversation)

1. Invoke the `pipeline-setup` skill using the `Skill` tool, passing `TASK_CONTEXT`
2. `cd` into the worktree

Store from result: `WORKTREE_PATH`, `BRANCH_NAME`, `CONSTITUTION`, `SPEC_NAME`, `SPEC_DIR`, `BASELINE_PATH`

### Stage 1: Brainstorm (Main Conversation)

1. Invoke the `brainstorm` skill using the `Skill` tool
2. After design approval, invoke the `spec-generation` skill (still in main session — it's quick and needs the brainstorm context)
3. Move/save spec output to `docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/spec.md`
4. Store `SPEC_PATH`

Then continue to Stage 2.

### Stage 2: Q&A (Main Conversation)

1. Invoke the `qa` skill using the `Skill` tool
2. Q&A explores the codebase and asks the user implementation-level questions interactively
3. After all questions are resolved, Q&A writes output to `docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/qa.md`
4. Store `QA_PATH`

Then continue to Stage 3 as a sub-agent.

### Stage 3: Planner

```
Agent(prompt="
  [PREAMBLE]
  Invoke the planning skill.
  Spec: <SPEC_PATH>. Q&A: <QA_PATH>. Write all outputs to docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/.
  Task context: <TASK_CONTEXT>
  Return: plan directory path, phase graph (DOT digraph from plan.md), summary.
")
```

**Extract from result:** `PLAN_DIR`, phase graph (DOT), phase count

### Stage 4: Coder

Dispatch based on phase and step dependency graphs. Two-level parallelism:

**Phase level:** Parse the phase graph from plan.md. Dispatch all ready nodes (no incomplete predecessors) in parallel. After each wave, recompute and dispatch next wave.

**Step level:** For each phase, read `phase-N.md` for a step graph. If present, apply the same wave-based dispatch. If absent, single agent for the whole phase.

For each phase, choose **one** dispatch strategy:

**A) Phase has no Steps section** → single agent for the whole phase:

```
Agent(prompt="
  [PREAMBLE]
  Invoke the tdd skill.
  Spec: <SPEC_PATH>. Plan: docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/plan.md. Phase: <PHASE_N>
  Return: files created/modified, tests with pass/fail and REQ/EDGE coverage, phase completed or blocked.
")
```

**B) Phase has Steps section** → dispatch per-step, parallelizing independent steps:

```
Agent(prompt="
  [PREAMBLE]
  Invoke the tdd and testing skill.
  Spec: <SPEC_PATH>. Plan: docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/plan.md.
  Phase: <PHASE_N>. Step: <STEP_DETAILS>
  Scope: Only implement and test what this step describes. Do not touch files outside this step's scope.
  Return: files created/modified, tests with pass/fail, step completed or blocked.
")
```

Dispatch in waves: send all independent steps in parallel → wait for completion → dispatch next wave of steps whose dependencies are satisfied → repeat until all steps in the phase are done.

### Stage 5: Quality Gate

Single quality gate after all coding is complete:

```
Agent(prompt="
  [PREAMBLE]
  Invoke the quality-gate skill.
  Baseline file: docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/baseline.json
  Plan dir: docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/
  Stage: post-tdd
  Return: gate report path, verdict (PASS/BLOCKED/STAGNATION).
")
```

**Extract from result:** verdict (PASS/BLOCKED/STAGNATION), gate report path

**If BLOCKED → stop pipeline and report what failed and potential ways to solve it. Do not proceed to Stage 6.**

**If STAGNATION → stop pipeline entirely. Do not retry. Report which check stagnated and the repeated error. This signals a fundamental issue that retrying won't fix.**

### Stage 6: Sync Docs

```
Agent(prompt="
  [PREAMBLE]
  Invoke the sync-docs skill.
  Spec dir: docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/
  Plan dir: docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/
  Return: list of docs updated/created.
")
```

**Extract from result:** list of docs updated/created

### Stage 7: Capture Learnings

```
Agent(prompt="
  [PREAMBLE]
  Invoke the learn skill.
  Focus on pipeline friction from this run — stalls, wrong assumptions, human interventions, retries.
  Spec dir: docs/spec/<SPEC_NAME>/
  If nothing went wrong, skip.
  Return: doc path written (or 'none').
")
```

**Extract from result:** learning doc path (if any)

### Stage 8: Commit & PR

```
Agent(prompt="
  [PREAMBLE]
  Invoke the git-commit skill to create commits.
  Then push: git push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME>
  Then create PR: gh pr create referencing task summary, spec, and plan.
  Return: commits list, PR URL.
")
```

**Extract from result:** commits, `PR_URL`

## Summary

After all stages complete, present a compact summary:

```markdown
## Pipeline Complete

**Task:** <TASK_CONTEXT summary>
**Worktree:** <WORKTREE_PATH> (branch: <BRANCH_NAME>)

| Stage | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 0. Setup | Worktree at <path>, baseline captured |
| 1. Brainstorm | Spec: docs/spec/<name>/spec.md |
| 2. Q&A | qa.md: <question_count> questions resolved |
| 3. Plan | <phase_count> phases, <parallel> parallel |
| 4. TDD | <files> files, <tests> tests passing |
| 5. Gate | <PASS/BLOCKED/STAGNATION> |
| 6. Sync Docs | <docs_count> docs updated |
| 7. Learnings | <doc_path or "none"> |
| 8. PR | <PR_URL> |

**Issues:** <any retries, failures, stagnation, or "None">
```

## Error Handling

- If any sub-agent fails or returns an error, **stop the pipeline** and report which stage failed and why
- If the quality gate returns BLOCKED, **stop the pipeline** and report what failed
- If the quality gate returns STAGNATION, **stop the pipeline entirely** — do not retry. Report which check stagnated, the repeated error signature, and that manual intervention is required
- Do not proceed to the next stage if the current one failed
- Present what was accomplished so far and suggest next steps
- Worktree is preserved for manual intervention on failure

---

## Key Principles

- **Each stage is isolated** — sub-agents don't share context, so pass all necessary information in the prompt
- **Constitution is universal** — every sub-agent gets the same rules via `[PREAMBLE]`, no exceptions
- **Extract artifacts** — after each sub-agent returns, extract file paths and key info to pass forward
- **Gate is a hard stop** — a BLOCKED verdict stops the pipeline, no workarounds
- **Parallelize from the graph** — dispatch ready nodes (no incomplete predecessors) in parallel, at both phase and step level
- **Stagnation stops early** — coder detects repeated failures and stops itself, don't loop endlessly
- **Spec folder structure** — all artifacts for a task live in `docs/spec/<name>/` for traceability
